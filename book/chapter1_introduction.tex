\section{\textbf{What} is quantum computing?}

    \textit{Quantum computing} sounds pretty intimidating to most people. What if I remove the ``quantum'' part, leaving only the ``computing'' part? 
    Much friendlier, huh? 
    The ``computing'' part is plain as simple: Give a system some input, and it will give you some output. 
    Now comes the jargon, ``quantum''. The word ``quantum'' comes from \textit{Quantum Mechanics}, a branch of physics that study tiny things. 
    Therefore, \textit{quantum computing} is essentially a way of using tiny particles to do calculation for us.
    The quantum computer manipulates on subatomic particles to do calculations, so you can imagine it is EXTREMELY difficult to build a quantum computer.
    Although there are prototypes of quantum computer as year of 2018, none of them has real application yet.
    However, quantum computing is not that far away from us.
    Actually, it will become an essential technology in the following decades.
