This is Yongli Chen's note on learning quantum computing. 
The reason the author write this book is simple: Although there are a few books on quantum computing, they are mainly focus on theory rather than application.
This book will introduce readers to quantum computing with a focus on applications as well as theory behind those applications.

In addition, this book will be written in a popular science style, which means it will contain A LOT OF explanations. 
This is because the author is using Feynman technique to study quantum computing, and would like to write down his thought process.
Please be aware.
